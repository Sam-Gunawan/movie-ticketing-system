The code is a complete ticketing system implementation included in a C++ class called TicketingSystem. This class effectively arranges features like adding and removing movies, securely allowing user logins using password input, and controlling the ticketing system's overall flow with methodical techniques. The class makes advantage of encapsulation principles, giving users a clean interface while concealing the actual workings. Grouping related functions inside the class improves the code structure and makes it easier to read and manage. Furthermore, TicketingSystem's private class manages UI-related activities, offering a clear division of responsibilities.
